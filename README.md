## Campaigning

I have a dream.  Even though we may all be different.  Even though we all have
different ideas, passions, and pursuits.  We all stand for things.  And those
stances deserve a platform.  A place to not bash on a rival, but to honestly
share **WHY**.  That is the vision of campaigning.

Oh yeah, and I really like [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
and thought this would be a fun spin off focused on arguing for something (usually
technologies and toolings...this is GitHub after all).

Also, I'm always trying to get my boss to try new technolgies ;)
